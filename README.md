## Usage
You may either

1. Use the built file (/dist/SuperSQL.php)
2. Use the library (include index.php)
3. Use composer (`composer require threeletters/supersql`) - Note, helper not available yet

```php
new SuperSQL($dsn,$user,$pass);
```
```php
use SuperSQL\SuperSQL;

// MySql setup
$host = "localhost";
$db = "test";
$user = "root";
$pass = "1234";

$dsn = "mysql:host=$host;port=3306;dbname=$db;charset=utf8";
$SuperSQL = new SuperSQL($dsn,$user,$pass);
```

```php
use SuperSQL\SQLHelper;

// MySql setup
$host = "localhost";
$db = "test";
$user = "root";
$pass = "1234";

$SuperSQL = SQLHelper::connect($host, $db, $user,$pass);
```
```php
$result = $SuperSQL->select("test",[],[
    "condition" => 12345,
    "[||][&&]" => [
        "something" => "value",
        "anotherthing" => "val"
    ]
]); // SELECT * FROM `test` WHERE `condition` = 12345 OR (`something` = 'value' AND `anotherthing` = 'val')

if (!$result->error()) {
foreach ($result as $val) { // NOTE, $result is NOT an array
    echo $val;
}
} else {
echo json_encode($result->error());
}
```

## FAQ

**Whats the difference between this and Medoo?**

Not much - they are basically the equivalant - However, SuperSQL is slightly more advanced.

* Response class - SuperSQL has a response class to access crucial information, such as errors
* Helper - SuperSQL comes with a helper class, with helper functions, while meedoo has it built right in.
* Smaller & lightweight - SuperSQL is smaller than medoo
* Development - SuperSQL's code is well structured and it is commented - so you can understand it more
* SuperSQL is faster - Using xdebug, we found that superSQL's parser is faster than medoo's. (x1000,100%)
